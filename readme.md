## Overview

The **FPN-CBAM-Classifier** is a deep learning-based image classification framework that combines the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) with the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). This model architecture aims to enhance feature representation and improve classification accuracy by effectively utilizing both spatial and channel-wise attention mechanisms.

## Features

- **FPN Backbone**: The Feature Pyramid Network enables the model to detect and classify objects at multiple scales, enhancing feature extraction.
- **CBAM Attention**: The Convolutional Block Attention Module refines feature maps by focusing on important information, improving the model's sensitivity to critical features.
- **Customizable Architecture**: The model is designed to be easily adaptable to different datasets and classification tasks.
- **Extensive Preprocessing**: Includes data augmentation and normalization techniques to improve generalization.
